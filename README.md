### Hi, I'm Malcolm Miles

Data Analyst Student/Digital Craftsman/Musician

Hey! I'm Malcolm Miles 👋
I'm a Data Analyst Student at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, I enjoy creating projects and learning new methods to coding. I put countless hours into this craft and am looking to bring value to theworld, one line of code at a time. Most projects are completed with little to 0 help and others built completely from the ground up. From planning and data collection, to designing plots and graphs to solve real world questions to sharpen my skills.

🔭 I’m currently working on a python project that shows the rollercoasters with the highest amount of G-Force

🌱 I’m currently learning some more advanced PosGreSQL along with some NLP in Python

💬 Ask me about the roller coaster project, I can even share fun facts about the data I pulled

😄 Pronouns: I go by He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: Im currently in the United States Air Force
